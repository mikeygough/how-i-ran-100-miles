**important**
Scroll down to load all the activity data you wish to include in your analysis. The page loads as you scroll. So if you export to .csv before loading
all the activites you want to analyze, your data will be truncated.

Once you've scrolled to load everything, click "Export CSV". Save the file to a convenient location on your computer.
