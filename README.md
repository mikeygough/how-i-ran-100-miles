## how long does it take to run 100 miles?

i've never been a runner and still don't consider myself one. but, in the second half of my senior year in college a friend challenged me to run a half marathon. so i did it. then i decided to run 100 miles.

i used a gps watch for most of my training and fortunately garmin stores that data. 

take a look to see how i evolved from never having run more than five miles to running one hundred in a single period (and more than 5,000 along the way)
