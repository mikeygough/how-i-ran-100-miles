## how long does it take to run 100 miles?

i've never been a runner and still don't consider myself one. then, towards the end of college a friend challenged me to run a half marathon (13.1 miles). so i did it.

then, a few weeks later i heard about people who run 100 mile races. i thought that's _impossible_. so in 2018 i decided to run a 100 mile marathon.

i used a gps watch during all my training which stored all my running data. in this project i analyze that data. why not take a look to see how i evolved from never having run more than five miles to running one hundred in a single period (and more than 5,000 along the way)

### future...
i'm starting to realize that this project should be extensible. what if i turn this notebook into a web app so other runners can upload their exported garmin data and get some neat graphics & such about their running performance? i think i'll do that, after completing my own analysis.
